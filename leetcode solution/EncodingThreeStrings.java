// Anand was tasked with encoding three input strings. His encoding method involves: 1) Splitting each string into three parts: front, middle, end 
// 2) Concatenating the parts to create three output 
// strings: Output1 = middle of input1 + front of input2 + end of input3 Output2 = end of input1 + middle of input2 + front of input3 Output3 = front of input1 + end of input2 + middle of input3 
// 3) Toggling the case of characters in the third output string. 
// The program splits each input string, concatenates the parts as specified, and toggles the third output strings character cases to produce the
